## Usage

```bash
rake build
```

The files `quran.txt` and `Scheherazade-Regular.ttf` must be present. See first couple of lines of `Rakefile` to see how to specify a different font or resolution. A folder called `output` will be created and populated. Afterwards, [gttxt2altoxml](https://git.saw-leipzig.de/sixtyfive/gttxt2altoxml) can be used to make the data viable for usage with kraken/ketos.
